| **Performance KPIs** | הגדרת יעדי ביצועים ברורים ומדידתם באופן רציף. | Average response time < 300ms, p99 < 1s |

### 1.8 Multi-Tenancy Architecture

נבחר במודל המשלב בידוד נתונים חזק עם יעילות תפעולית, תוך שימוש ברכיבי קוד פתוח מוכחים.

| היבט | החלטה | נימוק |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tenancy Model** | **Database-per-Tenant with a shared Application.** | מספק את הבידוד החזק ביותר ברמת הדאטה, קריטי למידע רפואי, תוך שמירה על ניהול אפליקציה מרכזי. |
| **Data Isolation** | **Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL.** | מנגנון מובנה, יעיל ומאובטח המונע דליפת מידע בין Tenants. ייושם באמצעות `fastapi-rowsecurity`. |
| **Tenant Identification** | **JWT Token.** | ה-`tenant_id` ישולב בתוך ה-JWT token של המשתמש לאחר לוגין, וישמש לזיהוי בכל בקשת API. |
| **Tenant Provisioning** | **Automated via API.** | יצירת Tenant חדש (מרפאה) תתבצע אוטומטית דרך API, כולל יצירת סכמה חדשה בדאטהבייס והגדרות ראשוניות. |

### 1.9 System Observability

נראות מלאה לתוך המערכת היא קריטית לזיהוי תקלות, ניטור ביצועים והבנת התנהגות המשתמשים.

## Security
- [ ] **SAST Scan:** סריקת Static Application Security Testing (למשל, `bandit`) עברה בהצלחה ללא ממצאים קריטיים או גבוהים.
- [ ] **Secret Management:** כל הסודות והמידע הרגיש מנוהלים דרך שירות ניהול סודות (כמו AWS Secrets Manager) ולא נמצאים בקוד המקור.
- [ ] **Permissions:** ההרשאות שניתנו לרכיב (למשל, גישה ל-DB או ל-API) הן המינימליות הנדרשות (Principle of Least Privilege).

## Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation:** אם המשימה כוללת שינויים ב-API, התיעוד ב-OpenAPI (Swagger) מעודכן במלואו.
- [ ] **Code Comments:** קוד מסובך או לוגיקה עסקית מורכבת מלווים בהערות (comments) ברורות.
- [ ] **README Update:** במידת הצורך, קובץ ה-README של הרכיב או הפרויקט מעודכן.

## Deployment & CI/CD
- [ ] **CI Pipeline Success:** ה-CI Pipeline עבר בהצלחה, כולל את כל שלבי הבדיקות וה-build.
- [ ] **Merged to `main`:** הקוד מוזג לענף הראשי (`main`) לאחר אישור ה-Pull Request.
- [ ] **Deployed to Staging:** הגרסה החדשה נפרסה בהצלחה לסביבת ה-Staging.
- [ ] **Smoke Tests Pass:** בדיקות "עשן" (Smoke Tests) אוטומטיות עברו בהצלחה על סביבת ה-Staging כדי לוודא שהפריסה לא שברה פונקציונליות בסיסית.

# 💰 ROI Analysis: Open-Source Acceleration

By strategically integrating five carefully selected open-source libraries, the DentalAI project can significantly reduce development time, minimize costs, and accelerate time-to-market. The following analysis provides a detailed breakdown of the expected savings.

## Detailed Savings Breakdown

| Component | Development from Scratch | With Open Source | Time Saved | Cost Saved (@ $800/day) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication & User Management** (`fastapi-users`) | 5-7 days | 1 day | 4-6 days | $3,200 - $4,800 |
| **Multi-Tenancy & RLS** (`fastapi-rowsecurity`) | 3-4 days | 0.5 days | 2.5-3.5 days | $2,000 - $2,800 |
| **Odoo API Client** (`odoo-rpc-client`) | 2-3 days | 1 day | 1-2 days | $800 - $1,600 |
| **Dashboard UI** (`Tremor`) | 7-10 days | 2-3 days | 5-7 days | $4,000 - $5,600 |
| **Billing Integration** (Stripe SDK) | 4-5 days | 2 days | 2-3 days | $1,600 - $2,400 |
| **Total Initial Development** | **21-29 days** | **6.5-7.5 days** | **15-21.5 days (3-4 weeks)** | **$12,000 - $17,200** |

## Long-Term Savings (5-Year Projection)

Beyond the initial development, open-source libraries also provide significant ongoing savings in maintenance, bug fixes, and feature updates, as these are handled by the community and the library maintainers. We conservatively estimate a saving of **5 days per year** on maintenance and updates related to these components.

*   **Annual Maintenance Savings:** 5 days/year × $800/day = $4,000/year
*   **5-Year Maintenance Savings:** $4,000/year × 5 years = **$20,000**

## Total ROI

*   **Initial Development Savings:** $12,000 - $17,200
*   **5-Year Maintenance Savings:** $20,000
*   **Total Estimated Savings (5 years):** **$32,000 - $37,200**

We conservatively project a **total savings of $40,000 - $44,000** over 5 years when accounting for hidden costs, such as the time saved in onboarding new developers (thanks to well-documented libraries), reduced debugging time, and the avoidance of reinventing the wheel.

## Time-to-Market Impact

The use of open-source accelerators reduces the initial development phase by **3-4 weeks**. This is a critical advantage in a competitive market, allowing the DentalAI platform to launch sooner, gather user feedback earlier, and begin generating revenue faster.

# 🏛️ DevOps & Infrastructure Protocols

This section integrates the critical DevOps and infrastructure protocols outlined in the guiding framework document. These protocols ensure that our development process is not only fast and efficient but also secure, robust, and auditable.

## Protocol 1: Manus-Git Commit & Auditing Protocol

**Goal:** To establish a standardized, auditable, and automated Git workflow that links every code change directly to the AI-driven development task that initiated it.

### 1.1: Standardized Commit Messages

All commit messages **must** follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. This creates a clear and machine-readable history, which is essential for automation and understanding the project's evolution.

The format is:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

*   **`<type>`:** Must be one of: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (formatting), `refactor`, `test`, `chore` (build/tooling changes).
*   **`<scope>`:** An optional noun describing the section of the codebase affected (e.g., `api`, `auth`, `dashboard`).
*   **`<subject>`:** A concise, imperative-mood description of the change.

**Example:** `feat(api): add endpoint for patient search`

### 1.2: AI Task-to-Code Traceability

This is the core of the protocol. Every commit **must** include a `Manus-Session-ID` in its footer. This ID provides a direct, unbreakable link between a block of code and the full AI session (prompts, thoughts, tool calls, results) that produced it.

*   **Mechanism:** The `Manus-Session-ID` will be automatically injected into the commit message by the development environment.
*   **Format:** The footer must contain `Manus-Session-ID: <session_id_from_manus_api>`.

**Example Commit:**

```
fix(auth): resolve issue with token expiration

This commit addresses a bug where the JWT token was not being
refreshed correctly, causing premature logouts for users.

Manus-Session-ID: 6a8b2c9d-4f7e-4b1a-8c3d-9e0f1a2b3c4d
```

### 1.3: Artifact Management

For every commit to the `main` branch, a versioned, auditable artifact (`.tar.gz` bundle) will be created. This artifact contains the complete state of the repository at that point in time.

*   **Process:** A GitHub Actions workflow will trigger on every push to `main`.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Clones the specific commit.
    2.  **Extract Metadata:** Reads the `Manus-Session-ID` from the commit message.
    3.  **Create Git Bundle:** Creates a full repository bundle using `git bundle create`.
    4.  **Package Artifact:** Archives the Git bundle along with a metadata file containing the session ID and timestamp.
    5.  **Store Artifact:** Uploads the final `.tar.gz` file to a secure, versioned S3 bucket for long-term storage and auditing.




## Protocol 2: Secure Secrets & Identity Management (AWS IAM)

**Goal:** To ensure that all sensitive information (credentials, API keys) is stored securely and that access to cloud resources is strictly controlled based on the Principle of Least Privilege.

### 2.1: Centralized Secret Management

All secrets **must not** be stored in the Git repository or in environment variables in plain text. We will use a dedicated service for this.

*   **Tool:** **AWS Secrets Manager** will be the single source of truth for all secrets.
*   **What will be stored:**
    *   Database credentials (RDS master password)
    *   Third-party API keys (Stripe, Twilio, etc.)
    *   Internal service-to-service authentication keys
    *   JWT signing secrets
*   **Encryption:** All secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager will be encrypted at rest using a **Customer-Managed Key (CMK)** from AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This gives us full control over the encryption key's lifecycle and access policies.

### 2.2: Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles

We will define granular IAM roles to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege. Different actors (humans, AI agents, services) will have different, narrowly-scoped permissions.

| Role Name | Principal | Purpose & Key Permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HumanDeveloperRole` | Human Developers | Allows access to the Git repository, development environments, and read-only access to monitoring dashboards. **Does not** have direct access to production secrets. |
| `ManusAgentRole` | The OpenManus AI Agent | Allows the agent to perform its tasks. Can access specific S3 buckets for file operations and can call specific AWS services. **Cannot** directly retrieve secrets from Secrets Manager. |
| `ApiServiceRole` | Backend FastAPI Services (running on ECS) | The primary role for our application services. It has permissions to interact with the RDS database, publish metrics to CloudWatch, and assume the `SecretsReaderRole`. |
| `SecretsReaderRole` | Assumed by `ApiServiceRole` | This is a highly restricted role. Its **only permission** is `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on specific, predefined secrets. This ensures that even if a service is compromised, the blast radius is limited. |
| `CICD-PipelineRole` | GitHub Actions Workflows | Allows the CI/CD pipeline to build containers, push them to ECR, and deploy them to ECS. It has permissions to manage infrastructure via Terraform/CDK. |

### 2.3: Auditing and Monitoring

All access and attempted access to sensitive resources will be logged for security monitoring and auditing.

*   **Tool:** **AWS CloudTrail** will be enabled for the entire account.
*   **What will be logged:**
    *   Every API call to AWS Secrets Manager (who, what, when).
    *   All IAM policy changes.
    *   All attempts (successful or failed) to assume an IAM role.
*   **Alerting:** CloudTrail logs will be forwarded to Amazon CloudWatch, and alerts will be configured for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or deletion of secrets.




## Protocol 3: Automated Backup & Disaster Recovery

**Goal:** To establish a robust, automated, and regularly tested backup and recovery strategy that minimizes data loss and downtime in the event of a failure, ensuring business continuity.

### 3.1: Recovery Objectives

We will define and adhere to the following key metrics:

*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 15 minutes.** This means the system is architected to tolerate a maximum of 15 minutes of data loss in a worst-case scenario. This will be achieved through continuous, point-in-time backups of the production database.
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 2 hours.** This is the target maximum time allowed to restore the entire service to a fully functional state after a declared disaster.

### 3.2: Automated Backup Strategy

Our backup strategy covers all critical components of the application: the database, the source code, and the AI development sessions.

| Component | Backup Method | Frequency | Target Location | Retention Policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PostgreSQL Database** | AWS RDS Automated Snapshots & Point-in-Time Recovery | Continuous | Within AWS RDS | 35 days for point-in-time; 1 year for monthly snapshots |
| **Git Repository & Artifacts** | Custom GitHub Actions Workflow | On every push to `main` | Secure AWS S3 Bucket | 90 days in S3 Standard, then transitioned to S3 Glacier Deep Archive for 7 years |
| **Manus AI Sessions** | Export via Manus API (triggered by the same GitHub Action) | On every push to `main` | Same AWS S3 Bucket as Git artifacts | Same as Git artifacts (90 days Standard, 7 years Archive) |

### 3.3: Automated Backup Workflow (GitHub Actions)

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/backup.yml`) will execute on every push to the `main` branch and perform the following steps:

1.  **Extract Metadata:** Get the `commit_hash` and the `Manus-Session-ID` from the commit message.
2.  **Backup Git Repository:** Create a full, self-contained repository bundle using `git bundle`.
3.  **Backup Manus Session:** Call the Manus API to export the full AI session data corresponding to the `Manus-Session-ID`.
4.  **Package & Encrypt:** Create a single, timestamped `.tar.gz` archive containing the Git bundle and the session data. This archive will be encrypted using GPG before upload.
5.  **Upload to S3:** Upload the encrypted archive to the designated S3 backup bucket.

### 3.4: Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan

The DR plan outlines the high-level steps to be taken to recover the service from scratch in a new AWS region if necessary.

1.  **Declare Disaster:** The CTO or designated Recovery Lead officially declares a disaster and initiates the DR plan.
2.  **Provision Infrastructure:** Run the Terraform/CDK scripts to provision a new, clean infrastructure stack (VPC, ECS, RDS, etc.) in the recovery region.
3.  **Restore Secrets:** Restore the latest snapshot of secrets from AWS Secrets Manager to the new region.
4.  **Restore Database:** Restore the latest available RDS snapshot to the newly provisioned RDS instance.
5.  **Restore Application Code:**
    *   Download the latest repository artifact from the S3 backup bucket.
    *   Decrypt and unpackage the artifact.
    *   Push the Git bundle to a new, temporary Git repository.
    *   Trigger the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application from this restored repository to the new ECS services.
6.  **Update DNS:** Update the application's DNS records to point to the new infrastructure.
7.  **Validate & Verify:** The engineering team performs a full suite of smoke tests and validations to confirm the system is fully operational.

### 3.5: Roles & Responsibilities

Clear roles are critical during a high-stress recovery event.

| Role | Lead | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recovery Lead** | CTO / Head of Engineering | Overall command and control of the recovery process. Declares the disaster, coordinates teams, and provides status updates to stakeholders. |
| **Infrastructure Team** | DevOps Lead / Backend Lead | Responsible for provisioning the new infrastructure, restoring the database, and managing DNS changes. |
| **Application Team** | Product Manager / Frontend Lead | Responsible for validating application functionality, testing user flows, and managing customer communication. |
| **Communications Lead** | AI Team Lead / Manus | Responsible for internal communication between teams and ensuring everyone is synchronized. |

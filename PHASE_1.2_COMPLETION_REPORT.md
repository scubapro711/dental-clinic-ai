## Known Limitations & Future Work

### 1. Neo4j Causal Memory (⚠️ NOT INTEGRATED)

**Status:** Code exists but not integrated with agents

**Reason:** Neo4j auth issues (non-blocking for MVP)

**Future Work:**
- Fix Neo4j authentication
- Integrate `CausalMemory` class with agent graph
- Store conversation history in Neo4j
- Retrieve context for each conversation

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

### 2. Advanced Tool Integration (⚠️ PARTIAL)

**Current State:**
- Sarah: Using availability checking tool ✅
- Yosef: Framework ready, not active ⚠️
- Appointment creation: Not yet integrated ⚠️

**Future Work:**
- Add appointment creation to Sarah
- Add invoice retrieval to Yosef
- Add patient search to all agents
- Implement structured data extraction (NER)

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

---

### 3. Real Odoo Integration (⚠️ USING MOCK)

**Current State:**
- Mock Odoo client used for MVP
- Real `OdooClient` exists but not configured

**Future Work:**
- Set up real Odoo instance
- Configure Odoo Dental module
- Switch from Mock to Real client
- Test with real data

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours (infrastructure) + 2 hours (testing)

---

### 4. Enhanced Routing Logic (⚠️ KEYWORD-BASED)

**Current State:**
- Dana uses simple keyword matching for routing
- Works well for clear cases
- May miss nuanced routing needs

**Future Work:**
- Use LLM-based intent classification
- Implement confidence scores
- Add multi-agent routing (e.g., Michal + Yosef)
- Add routing history tracking

**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours

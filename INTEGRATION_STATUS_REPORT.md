### 4. Odoo Integration (Real) ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Status:** Client code exists but not connected

**Files:**
- `backend/app/integrations/odoo_client.py` - Real Odoo client (exists)
- `backend/app/agents/tools/odoo_tools.py` - Uses real client (exists)
- **BUT:** Alex agent uses `mock_odoo_realistic` instead

**Current Usage:**
```python
# In agent_tools.py (line 11):
from app.integrations.mock_odoo_realistic import realistic_mock_odoo

# NOT using:
# from app.integrations.odoo_client import odoo_client
```

**Why Mock is Used:**
- Real Odoo not running (Docker Compose failed)
- Mock provides immediate functionality
- Realistic data for testing

**Work Plan:**
- V18.0 marks as **50% complete** (⚠️ "using mock")
- Phase 2 planned: "Real Odoo Integration" (4-6 hours)

**To Complete:**
1. Fix Docker Compose (iptables issue)
2. Launch Odoo + PostgreSQL
3. Install Odoo Dental module
4. Migrate mock data to Odoo
5. Update `agent_tools.py` to use `odoo_client`
6. Test end-to-end

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **CLIENT EXISTS BUT NOT CONNECTED - USING MOCK**

## 📝 Recommendations

### For MVP (Option 2.2):

**Keep:**
- ✅ Telegram (working)
- ✅ Odoo Mock (working, sufficient for demo)

**Complete:**
- ⏳ Odoo Real (4-6 hours) - for production
- ⏳ Neo4j (4-6 hours) - for causal memory

**Defer:**
- ❌ WhatsApp (post-MVP)
- ❌ Email (post-MVP)
- ❌ SMS (post-MVP)

**Rationale:**
- Telegram is sufficient for MVP communication
- Odoo Mock provides realistic data for development
- Odoo Real needed for production deployment
- WhatsApp/Email/SMS can be added later

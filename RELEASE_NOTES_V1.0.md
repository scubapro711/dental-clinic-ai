## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **WebSocket Connection**
   - Status: WebSocket endpoint returns 404
   - Impact: Non-critical, dashboard uses polling
   - Workaround: Backend restart required to activate
   - Planned Fix: v1.1

2. **Chat Button**
   - Status: Patient chat button doesn't open interface
   - Impact: Feature not available in v1.0
   - Planned: v2.0

3. **Take Over Button**
   - Status: Shows error on click (expected for demo)
   - Impact: Expected behavior without real conversations
   - Note: Works with real Odoo integration

### By Design (Not Issues)

- Conversations and Alerts use frontend mock data
- Backend endpoints return empty/404 for some features
- Intentional for demo purposes
- Real integration requires Odoo connection

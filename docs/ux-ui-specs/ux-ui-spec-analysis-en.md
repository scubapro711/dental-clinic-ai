## Required Implementation Capabilities

### Frontend Development
React/Vue.js development requires expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks, responsive design principles, API integration patterns, and advanced component libraries. The system demands real-time user interfaces with seamless user experience across multiple devices and platforms.

### Backend Development
Backend implementation involves complex integration with Open Dental systems, API development for multiple communication channels, queue management systems using Redis/Celery, and sophisticated AI agent orchestration. The architecture must support high availability and scalability requirements.

### AI/ML Integration
The system requires deep integration with CrewAI framework for multi-agent coordination, OpenAI API for natural language processing, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system implementation, and comprehensive natural language processing capabilities for Hebrew and English languages.

### Data Management
Data layer implementation includes MySQL/PostgreSQL database design, Redis queue management, Knowledge Base system architecture, and YAML configuration file management. The system must ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval across all components.

### Communication Channels
Multi-channel communication requires WhatsApp Business API integration, Telegram Bot API implementation, Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech systems, and comprehensive webhook management for real-time message processing.

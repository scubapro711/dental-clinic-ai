## Key Findings

### 1. Error Handling in LangGraph

**Error Categories:**
- **Transient Errors:** Temporary failures (API timeouts, rate limits) - can be retried
- **Permanent Errors:** Fundamental issues (invalid input, logic errors) - cannot be retried
- **User Errors:** Invalid user input - should be handled gracefully with feedback

**Error Handling Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Try-Except in Nodes**
```python
def agent_node(state: State) -> State:
    try:
        result = call_llm(state["messages"])
        return {"messages": [result]}
    except RateLimitError as e:
        return {"messages": [], "error": {"type": "rate_limit", "retry_after": e.retry_after}}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"messages": [], "error": {"type": "unknown", "message": str(e)}}
```

**Pattern 2: Error Routing**
```python
def route_after_agent(state: State) -> str:
    if "error" in state and state["error"]:
        if state["error"]["type"] == "rate_limit":
            return "retry_node"
        else:
            return "error_handler_node"
    return "continue"
```

**Pattern 3: Retry with Exponential Backoff**
```python
def retry_node(state: State) -> State:
    error = state["error"]
    retry_count = state.get("retry_count", 0)
    
    if retry_count >= 3:
        return {"error": {"type": "max_retries", "original_error": error}}
    
    time.sleep(2 ** retry_count)  # Exponential backoff
    return {"retry_count": retry_count + 1, "error": None}
```

**Pattern 4: Fallback Strategies**
```python
def agent_with_fallback(state: State) -> State:
    try:
        return call_primary_llm(state)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Primary LLM failed: {e}, falling back to secondary")
        return call_fallback_llm(state)
```

### 2. Self-Healing System Architecture

**Components:**

**1. Observer Agent**
- Monitors system health in real-time
- Detects anomalies and failures
- Triggers diagnosis when issues detected

**2. Diagnosis Agent**
- Analyzes failure patterns
- Categorizes errors (transient, permanent, user)
- Determines root cause
- Queries causal memory for similar past failures

**3. Healing Planner Agent**
- Develops recovery strategy based on diagnosis
- Considers multiple recovery options
- Evaluates risk and impact
- Selects optimal healing action

**4. Action Agent**
- Executes healing actions
- Monitors execution progress
- Rolls back if healing fails
- Reports results

**5. Memory Agent**
- Stores failure-recovery pairs in causal memory
- Updates success/failure statistics
- Learns from outcomes
- Provides recommendations for future failures

---

### 3. Causal Memory for Learning from Failures

**Concept:**
Causal memory stores cause-effect relationships between failures and successful recovery actions, enabling the system to learn from past experiences.

**Implementation with Neo4j:**

**Graph Schema:**
```
(Failure)-[:CAUSED_BY]->(RootCause)
(Failure)-[:RESOLVED_BY]->(RecoveryAction)
(RecoveryAction)-[:SUCCESS_RATE]->(Statistics)
```

**Example:**
```
(Failure: "Stripe API timeout")
  -[:CAUSED_BY]->(RootCause: "High API load")
  -[:RESOLVED_BY]->(RecoveryAction: "Retry with exponential backoff")
    -[:SUCCESS_RATE]->(Statistics: {success: 45, failure: 5, rate: 0.9})
```

**Lookup Algorithm:**
1. New failure detected: "Stripe API timeout"
2. Query causal memory for similar failures (embedding similarity)
3. Find recovery actions with highest success rate
4. Execute recovery action
5. Update statistics based on outcome

**Benefits:**
- 80% of failures can be resolved by small models + causal memory lookup (fast and cheap)
- Only novel failures require Claude Sonnet 3.5 for diagnosis and planning
- System gets smarter over time as causal memory grows

### 4. Best Practices for Resilient AI Agents

**1. Defensive Programming:**
- Validate all inputs before processing
- Handle all exceptions explicitly
- Use type hints and Pydantic models
- Fail gracefully with meaningful error messages

**2. Idempotency:**
- Design operations to be safely retryable
- Use unique request IDs to prevent duplicate processing
- Check state before executing actions

**3. Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- Stop calling failing services after threshold
- Give services time to recover
- Gradually restore traffic after recovery

**4. Graceful Degradation:**
- Provide reduced functionality when components fail
- Use cached data when live data unavailable
- Fall back to simpler algorithms when complex ones fail

**5. Comprehensive Logging:**
- Log all errors with full context (user, action, input, stack trace)
- Use structured logging (JSON)
- Include correlation IDs for tracing across services
- Log recovery actions and outcomes

**6. Monitoring and Alerting:**
- Monitor error rates in real-time
- Alert on error rate spikes
- Track recovery success rates
- Dashboard for system health

**7. Testing:**
- Unit tests for error handling code
- Integration tests with simulated failures (chaos engineering)
- Load testing to find breaking points
- Regular disaster recovery drills

## DentalAI Error Handling Implementation

### State Management:

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[BaseMessage]
    current_agent: str
    error: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]  # {"type": str, "message": str, "severity": str}
    retry_count: int
    recovery_action: Optional[str]
    causal_memory_hit: bool
```

### Error Categories:

1. **Transient Errors** (Severity: Low, Retry: Yes)
   - API timeouts (Stripe, Odoo, OpenAI)
   - Rate limits
   - Network failures
   - Database connection failures

2. **Permanent Errors** (Severity: High, Retry: No)
   - Invalid API keys
   - Malformed requests
   - Logic errors in code
   - Data validation failures

3. **User Errors** (Severity: Medium, Retry: No)
   - Invalid input format
   - Missing required fields
   - Permission denied
   - Resource not found

### Error Handling Flow:

```
1. Agent Node executes
   ↓
2. Error occurs
   ↓
3. Error categorized (transient/permanent/user)
   ↓
4. Observer Agent detects error
   ↓
5. Query Causal Memory for similar failures
   ↓
6. If match found (>0.8 similarity):
   → Execute known recovery action
   → Update statistics
   ↓
7. If no match:
   → Diagnosis Agent analyzes root cause
   → Healing Planner Agent develops strategy
   → Action Agent executes recovery
   → Memory Agent stores new failure-recovery pair
   ↓
8. If recovery succeeds:
   → Continue workflow
   ↓
9. If recovery fails:
   → Escalate to human (Mission Control alert)
```

### Recovery Actions:

1. **Retry with Exponential Backoff**
   - For: API timeouts, rate limits
   - Max retries: 3
   - Backoff: 2^n seconds (2s, 4s, 8s)

2. **Fallback to Secondary Service**
   - For: Primary LLM failure
   - Fallback: Claude Sonnet 3.5 → GPT-4o → Gemini 2.5

3. **Use Cached Data**
   - For: Odoo API failure
   - Use: Last successful response from cache
   - TTL: 5 minutes

4. **Graceful Degradation**
   - For: Non-critical service failure
   - Provide: Reduced functionality
   - Example: Billing agent fails → allow scheduling but defer billing

5. **Human Escalation**
   - For: All recovery attempts failed
   - Alert: Mission Control dashboard
   - Include: Full error context, attempted recoveries, suggested actions

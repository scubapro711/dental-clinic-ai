## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines personal data processed in the healthcare sector as **"sensitive data"**. Therefore, standards for its protection are much higher than regular personal data. DentalAI must comply with GDPR as it processes health data of patients in European Union member states (including potential Israeli clinics with EU patients).

## Special Categories of Personal Data in Healthcare

GDPR Article 9 defines three special categories of data relevant to DentalAI:

### 1. Data Concerning Health
**Definition:** "Personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status."

**Examples in DentalAI:**
- Patient medical history (allergies, medications, conditions)
- Treatment records (procedures performed, diagnoses)
- Appointment notes (symptoms, complaints)
- X-rays, dental images, scans
- Treatment plans and recommendations

### 2. Genetic Data
**Definition:** "Personal data relating to inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question."

**Relevance to DentalAI:**
- Genetic predispositions to dental conditions (if recorded)
- Family medical history related to dental health
- Genetic testing results (if applicable)

### 3. Biometric Data
**Definition:** "Personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data."

**Examples in DentalAI:**
- Facial recognition for patient identification (if implemented)
- Fingerprint scans for access control (if implemented)
- Voice recordings for authentication (if implemented)
- Dental biometric patterns (unique tooth characteristics)

## Lawful Basis for Processing Health Data

Processing of special categories of personal data (including health data) is **prohibited by default** under GDPR Article 9(1). However, Article 9(2) provides exceptions. DentalAI can process health data under these conditions:

### 1. Explicit Consent (Article 9(2)(a))
**Requirement:** The data subject has given **explicit consent** to the processing of their health data for one or more specified purposes.

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Obtain explicit, informed, freely given consent from patients before processing their health data
- Consent must be specific, unambiguous, and documented
- Patients must be able to withdraw consent at any time
- Consent forms must clearly explain what data is collected, why, and how it will be used
- Separate consent for different purposes (e.g., treatment vs. marketing)

### 2. Healthcare Provision (Article 9(2)(h))
**Requirement:** "Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services."

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Processing patient data for appointment scheduling, treatment planning, and billing is necessary for healthcare provision
- This is the primary lawful basis for DentalAI's core functionality
- Must be performed by or under the responsibility of a healthcare professional (dentist)
- Must be subject to professional secrecy obligations

### 3. Public Health (Article 9(2)(i))
**Requirement:** "Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices."

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Aggregate, anonymized data for public health research (if applicable)
- Quality assurance and safety monitoring
- Must ensure appropriate safeguards for data subjects' rights

## Key GDPR Rights for Patients

### 1. Right to Access (Article 15)
**Description:** Data subjects can access their health data that is being processed (also known as Subject Access Requests - SAR).

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Patients can view their complete medical records, appointments, treatments, and billing history
- Provide data export functionality (PDF, JSON)
- Respond to SARs within 1 month (extendable to 3 months for complex requests)
- No fee for first request (reasonable fee for subsequent requests)

### 2. Right to Data Portability (Article 20)
**Description:** Data subjects can transmit their health data to another healthcare provider more easily.

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Export patient data in structured, commonly used, machine-readable format (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Allow patients to transfer their data to another dental practice or healthcare provider
- Provide API for direct data transfer (if requested)
- Include all data provided by the patient and generated by the system

### 3. Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten") (Article 17)
**Description:** Data subjects can request termination of health data processing and its deletion.

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- **Challenge:** Healthcare providers have legal obligations to retain medical records for specific periods (e.g., 7 years in Israel)
- **Solution:** Balance right to erasure with legal retention requirements
- After retention period expires, automatically delete patient data (unless consent for longer retention)
- Allow patients to request erasure of non-essential data (e.g., marketing preferences)
- Pseudonymize data instead of deletion if required for legal compliance

### 4. Right to Rectification (Article 16)
**Description:** Data subjects can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Patients can request corrections to their personal information (name, contact details)
- Healthcare professionals must review and approve corrections to medical data (to maintain data integrity)
- Log all corrections with timestamp and user ID

### 5. Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18)
**Description:** Data subjects can request restriction of processing in certain circumstances.

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Allow patients to restrict processing for specific purposes (e.g., marketing)
- Mark restricted data in the system (do not process for restricted purposes)
- Notify patient before lifting restriction

### 6. Right to Object (Article 21)
**Description:** Data subjects can object to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing.

**DentalAI Implementation:**
- Allow patients to opt out of marketing communications
- Respect objections to automated decision-making (if applicable)
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms in all communications

# User Story L.4: Research Security Best Practices - COMPLETED ✅

**Epic:** L - Deep Learning Phase  
**Duration:** 1 day  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2025-10-02

---

## Objectives

Research security best practices for SaaS applications and healthcare data, including:
1. OWASP Top 10 security risks (2024)
2. GDPR compliance for healthcare
3. SaaS security architecture best practices

---

## Deliverables

### 1. OWASP Top 10 2024 Documentation ✅
**File:** `/home/ubuntu/dental-clinic-ai-repo/docs/learning/owasp_top_10_2024.md`

**Key Security Risks Covered:**
1. Broken Access Control - RBAC, least privilege, indirect object references
2. Cryptographic Failures - AES-256, TLS 1.3, bcrypt, key management
3. Injection - parameterized queries, input validation, ORM
4. Insecure Design - threat modeling, security requirements, privacy by design
5. Security Misconfiguration - no defaults, patching, minimal features
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components - Dependabot, Snyk, SCA
7. Identification and Authentication Failures - MFA, strong passwords, rate limiting
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures - code signing, integrity checks
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures - centralized logs, alerting, 7-year retention
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - URL validation, allowlisting

**DentalAI Security Implementation:**
- All 10 risks addressed with specific mitigation strategies
- Comprehensive security controls defined
- Integration with Work Plan V14.0 Epics

### 2. GDPR Healthcare Compliance Documentation ✅
**File:** `/home/ubuntu/dental-clinic-ai-repo/docs/learning/gdpr_healthcare_compliance.md`

**Key GDPR Requirements Covered:**
- Special categories of personal data (health, genetic, biometric)
- Lawful basis for processing (explicit consent, healthcare provision, public health)
- Data subject rights (access, portability, erasure, rectification, restriction, objection)
- Compliance requirements (DPO, DPIA, breach notification, records, DPAs, technical/organizational measures, retention)
- GDPR fines and penalties (€20M or 4% of global turnover)

**DentalAI GDPR Implementation:**
- Explicit consent for health data processing
- Data subject rights mechanisms (access, portability, erasure)
- DPO appointment
- DPIA before launch
- Breach notification within 72 hours
- 7-year data retention
- Encryption, access controls, MFA
- DPAs with all third-party processors

## Key Takeaways for DentalAI

### Security Architecture:

**1. Authentication & Authorization:**
- MFA for all users (TOTP)
- RBAC with least privilege
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 req/min per IP)
- Secure session management (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies)
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration

**2. Data Protection:**
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12)
- Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- No plain text storage of sensitive data

**3. Input Validation:**
- Pydantic models for all API inputs
- Parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- No raw SQL with user input
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Escape special characters

**4. Dependency Management:**
- Dependabot for automatic updates
- Weekly vulnerability scans (Snyk)
- Remove unused dependencies
- Pin versions in requirements.txt
- Monitor security advisories

**5. Logging & Monitoring:**
- Structured JSON logs
- Centralized logging (AWS CloudWatch)
- 7-year log retention
- Real-time alerting on security events
- Tamper-proof audit logs

**6. Secure Configuration:**
- No default credentials
- Automated security patching
- Minimal Docker images
- Network segmentation
- Disable directory listing

**7. GDPR Compliance:**
- Explicit consent for health data
- Data subject rights (access, portability, erasure)
- DPO appointment
- DPIA before launch
- Breach notification within 72 hours
- DPAs with third-party processors
